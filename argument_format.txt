Format to passing arguments to TECO model

% Option 0 and option 1 have same argument:
./TECO.out input/SPRUCE_pars.txt input/SPRUCE_forcing.txt input/SPRUCE_obs.txt output/ 0 input/SPRUCE_da_pars.txt

% Option 2:
./TECO.out input/SPRUCE_pars.txt input/SPRUCE_forcing.txt input/SPRUCE_obs.txt output/ 2 input/SPRUCE_da_pars.txt input/Weathergenerate 2024 365 2.25 380.0

% 1st argument is parameter file generated from portal
% 2nd argument is historical forcing file from SPRUCE site
% 3rd argument is observation file, data complied manually or will be partially automated 
% 4th argument is output folder
% 5th argument is 0, 1 and 2 to run simulation, data assimilation or forecasting, respectively
% 6th argument is DA checkbox file generated from portal, users can choose what parameters to do DA
% 7th argument is the future forcing files, pre-generated by stochastic model
% 8th argument is the year users want to forecast (maximum 2024)
% 9th argument is the day of the year users want to forecast
% 10th argument is temperature treatment (default 0.0, allow users to add 0~9 celsius degree)
% 11th argument is CO2 treatment (default ambient atmosphere 380.0ppm, allow users to type 380~900ppm)
